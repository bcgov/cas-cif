###Description of the Tech Debt###




###Tech Debt Triage#
The purpose of our technical debt triage process is to analyze technical debt to determine type, cause, solutions, benefits, and risk level. A score is assigned to technical debt to determine the risk level which will assist the PO in prioritizing technical debt in the backlog.

Causes:                                                               
- [ ] Poor Conception                                       
- [ ] Poor Scheduling                                        
- [ ] Bad Development Practice                       
- [ ] Outdated Technology                                
- [ ] Quick vs Quality Imbalance  
                   
Types:
- [ ] Source Code Formatting
- [ ] Low Test Coverage
- [ ] Lack of Modularity
- [ ] Code Complexity
- [ ] Lack of Documentation

Risk Value Scoring:     

 |Level|Value|

 |High|3|
 |Medium|2|
 |Low|1|


 | Technical Debt - Risk Types |  Level  | Value |
 | ----------------------------|---------|-------|
 |Business Area Risk - Risk of business area visibility / damage to user experience|    |      |
 |Developer Fault Risk - How likely will this tech debt cause a future error related to coding on top of it|  |  |
 |System Fault Risk - Risk of system errors or application downtime |  |  |
 |Time Scale Risk - Compound risk effect if left alone. How much more difficult to fix or dangerous will this become over time?|  |  |
 |Time Sink Risk - How much will this tech debt slow the development process down | | |
 |TOTAL SCORE:| | |
