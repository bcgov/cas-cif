# CIF app disaster recovery

In case of a database corruption, crash or any other issue requiring us to restore the database to a previous state, the OpenShift `PostgresCluster` object allows us to restore the database from any point in time prior to the incident.

---

## Makefile target

**Prerequisites:**

- The ENVIRONMENT (dev,test,prod) and CIF_NAMESPACE_PREFIX, GGIRCS_NAMESPACE_PREFIX, CIIP_NAMESPACE_PREFIX environment variables are set
- The machine is logged in onto the cluster where the CIF app is deployed (`oc login ...`)

**Restoring the DB:**

To restore the database to any point in time, simply run:

```
make restore TARGET_TIMESTAMP="2022-05-24 15:20:00-07"
```

where TARGET_TIMESTAMP follows the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS-ZZ'

This will create a restore job with the `postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/pgbackrest-restore` label.
Once this job is completed, the restore operation is completed, and the application can be redeployed to its original state.

:warning: Some target environments (-dev and -test) have a `db-pre-upgrade` job that might erase the database and revert the effects of the restore operation.

```
make install
```

## Helm values

This section goes in depth with how to manually restore the database, all of the following is automated in the above `make` target.

To allow restoring with the [helm chart](https://github.com/bcgov/cas-cif/tree/develop/chart/cas-cif), the bucket provisioning and database pre-upgrade jobs have been disabled directly in the chart when the restore option is enabled.
A few more values need to be adjusted:

To avoid running some jobs and airflow DAGs:

```yaml
# chart/cas-cif/values.yaml
deploy-db:
  enabled: false
download-dags:
  enabled: false
```

To enable the restore option,

```yaml
# chart/cas-cif/values.yaml
db:
  restore:
    enabled: false
    targetTimestamp: "2022-06-06 13:00:00-07" # or the point in time at which to restore
```

Finally, to deploy the chart and restore the db,

```
helm upgrade <Deployment Name> chart/cas-cif/
```
